# Installation

Installed 
* Python (current version), 
* NVidia CUDA SDK (older version since the newest version does not work with Tensorflow), 
* NVidias DNN DLL, 
* Visual Studio Community Edition (C++, Python, Windows 10 SDK, older Build Pipeline, to build and run NVidia examples and utilities which are not shipped binary anymore),
* Tensorflow, 
* IPython, 
* Jupyter

# Post-installation verification

see files in directory:
* `hello_world.log`
* `deviceQuery_bandwithTest.log`

# First tutorial: Mandelbrot

I chose this one as it does not actually include DNNs and I thought it might be a good introduction to Tensorflow basics.
